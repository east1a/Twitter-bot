This is code for a twitter bot solving a small problem I encountered while trying to track the price movement of Bitcoin.
I follow an account that notifys me of large movements of the most popular coins but I don't really care about any others so I created this to filter out
only the BTC price alerts. It is a stepping stone project that I will eventually use to read data directly from the price movement on the BTC blockchain 
instead of just third-party the data from WhaleAlert.

Functionally, this bot will retweet every tweet from WhaleAlert that has to do with price movement of BTC, and I only turn notifications on for this bot, 
however, I am not sure how long I will keep this script open without a dedicated piece of hardware to do it for me. I will most likely just keep it on my 
portfolio and start working on the next project that will read from the real data.
